Thiyagarajan; Hajira Basit; Rebecca Jeanmonod.\nLast Updated: October 24, 2022.\n\nHello dear reader, understanding your body and its unique rhythm will enable you to live a healthier and more balanced lifestyle. When it comes to the female reproductive system, the menstrual cycle is a regular phenomenon that prepares your body for possible pregnancy and fertilization. Let's explore this in detail.\n\nMenstrual Cycle Overview:\n\nYour menstrual cycle, characterized by periodic vaginal bleeding due to uterine mucose shedding (menstruation) starts at puberty and ends at menopause. It mostly varies, but for you, it seems to stick to an average length of around 28 days. \n\nMenstrual Cycle and Hormone Regulation:\n\nYour menstrual cycle is dependent on hormones secreted through a feedback mechanism. When you reached puberty, your hypothalamus started releasing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone triggers the anterior pituitary to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), hence prompting ovarian hormone production. This hormone regulation occurs in three phases - follicular/proliferative phase, ovulation, and the luteal or secretory phase.\n\nFollicular Phase:\n\nFor the first 14 days of your menstrual cycle, your body experiences the follicular or proliferative phase. The main hormone during this part of the cycle is estrogen, specifically 17-beta-estradiol. The purpose of this phase is to grow the endometrial layer of the uterus, preparing it for potential pregnancy. \n\nOvulation:\n\nTypically, you should expect ovulation, the release of a mature follicle, around 14 days before your next period. At the end of the follicular phase, just prior to ovulation, high levels of 17-beta-estradiol are experienced due to follicle maturation and increased hormone production. \n\nThe Luteal or Secretory Phase:\n\nPost-ovulation, from day 14 to 28, marks the luteal phase or the secretory part of your cycle. Here, progesterone dominates, preparing the corpus luteum and endometrium for a potential fertilized ovum implantation.\n\nNormal Menstruation:\n\nWhen hormone levels decrease, your menstruation occurs. This marks day 0 to 5 of the next menstrual cycle. The duration of menstruation varies, with yours averaging around 5 days.\n\nAnovulatory Cycles:\n\nIn certain circumstances, ovulation might not occur, these times are termed anovulatory cycles and often appear in the first 12-18 months after the first menstrual period (menarche), and again before menopause.\n\nClinical Significance:\n\nUnderstanding your menstrual cycle is crucial. It helps you identify any complications or discomfort that may need medical attention. It's common to experience premenstrual symptoms like mood swings, cramping, and bloating as noted in your symptoms tracking information. \n\nMaintaining lifestyle habits like regular exercise, adequate sleep and a balanced diet, along with the use of contraceptives like birth control pills can influence and regulate your menstrual cycle positively. Always keep in mind, knowledge about your menstrual cycle provides the groundwork for understanding how your body prepares for potential pregnancy, crucial for family planning and the management of potential infertility.\n\nSuggested Reading:\n\n[1] Physiology of the menstrual cycle.
